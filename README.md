# 508
HCDE 508 course's final project | Redesign of http://jordan-vincent.com

**View the final prototype here: https://hcde508.herokuapp.com**

This work mainly focused on creating a strong identity. The mountain metaphor is present throughout the website. The design imitates the layout of magazine, using bold titles, quick introductions, quotes, and captions. It makes it easier to read, browse, and doesnâ€™t overwhelm the user.

Features:
- Desktop and responsive mobile version
- Parallax effect on hero images
- Sticky navigation bar
- Animated projects on hover
- Animated menu on mobile
- Seamless transition to the project page on mobile
- Animated 3D business card (click on the mountain in the footer to view it)

*PS: Don't take the code as an example. It hasn't been developed with reusability in mind, rather I wanted to iterate rapidly and experiment with CSS and SVG animations.*

### Build
- Install: ```npm install```, ```bower install```
- Develop: ```grunt serve```
